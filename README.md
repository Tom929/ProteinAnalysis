# ProteinAnalysis 1.1
Python 3.7

Program by: Tom Resink (Biochemistry student, Imperial College London)

Simple program that can be utilized to predict the proteins of a protein from its primary sequence.
It is currently being used to aid in the decision of running size exclusion chromatography or ion exchange chromatography on the secretome of *Pichia pastoris*

Current features:
- Convert three letter code to one letter code
- Predict the charge of multiple polypeptides at different pH (*NEW*)
- Predict the mass in kDA of multiple polypeptides (*NEW*)
