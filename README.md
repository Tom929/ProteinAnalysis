# ProteinAnalysis 2.0
Python 3.7

Program by: Tom Resink (Biochemistry student, Imperial College London)

Simple program that can be utilized to predict the propertiesof a protein from its primary sequence.
It is currently being used to aid in the decision of running size exclusion chromatography or ion exchange chromatography on the secretome of *Pichia pastoris*

How to use:
- Paste each database accession number for UniProt/SwissProt on a new line in ProteinInput.txt
- navigate to the ProteinAnalysis folder in your terminal
- run Main.py

Current features:
- Predict the charge of multiple polypeptides at different pH
- Predict the mass in kDA of multiple polypeptides
- Linked to SwissProt/UniProt database (*New*)
- Can take database accession numbers as input (*New*)
